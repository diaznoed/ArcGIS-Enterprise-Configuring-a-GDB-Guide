how to unlock schema in ArcPro

Open ArcPro (make sure you are in DBO or SA when connecting to DB)

Right click the dataset with the schema locks, and click "locks"

Click on the feature you want to unlock, and disconnect from the database.

The server logs might indicate the dataconnection loss, the connection will create. 


Understanding Phantom Locks in ArcGIS Pro

What are Phantom Locks?

In ArcGIS Pro, phantom locks occur when a process or session appears to be holding a lock on a resource (like a feature class or geodatabase) even though that process or session has ended. This can prevent other users from accessing and editing the resource.

Why do Phantom Locks Happen?

Several reasons can lead to phantom locks:

Unexpected Application Crashes: If ArcGIS Pro crashes while editing a resource, it might leave a lock behind.
Network Connectivity Issues: Intermittent network connectivity can disrupt communication between ArcGIS Pro and the database, leading to locks.
Database Server Issues: Problems with the database server itself can cause locks to remain.
Incorrectly Closed Sessions: Sometimes, sessions might not close properly, leaving behind locks.
How to Clear Phantom Locks in ArcGIS Pro

1. Check for Locks in ArcGIS Pro:

Open ArcGIS Pro.
Go to Geodatabase Administration > Data Access > List Locks.
Look for any locks associated with your username or other users that appear to be inactive.
2. Use the "Kill Lock" Option (with caution):

Important Note: Using "Kill Lock" can potentially corrupt data if the process holding the lock is still active. Exercise extreme caution.
In the "List Locks" window, right-click on the lock you want to clear and select "Kill Lock".
3. Restart ArcGIS Pro:

Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve phantom locks by releasing any lingering connections.
4. Restart the Database Server (if applicable):

If the phantom locks are persistent and you have access to the database server, restarting it might help. However, ensure this is done during off-peak hours and with proper coordination.
5. Check Database Logs:

Examine the database logs for any error messages or indications of processes that might be causing the locks.
6. Use ArcGIS Server Manager (if applicable):

If your geodatabase is hosted on ArcGIS Server, you can use the ArcGIS Server Manager to check for and clear locks.
Important Considerations:

Always Backup Data: Before attempting to clear locks, ensure you have a recent backup of your geodatabase to minimize potential data loss.
Coordinate with Other Users: If multiple users are accessing the geodatabase, coordinate with them to avoid conflicts and unintended consequences.
Seek Help from Administrators: If you're unable to resolve the issue, consult with your database administrator or ArcGIS administrator for further assistance.
Additional Tips:

Avoid Editing the Same Data Simultaneously: Multiple users editing the same data at the same time can increase the likelihood of lock conflicts.
Close Unused Sessions: When you're finished working with a geodatabase, close all open sessions to release any locks.
Use Versioning: Versioning can help manage concurrent editing and reduce lock contention.
